        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Ever been at home and had no idea what to eat? Too lazy to get take-out, too broke to order delivery?
            Dont't know how to cook? Well don't worry, this recipe is beginner friendly and can be made with ingredients
            you have at home. It's one of my comfort meals, quick to make and actually fun since since you do an appropriate amount of cutting
            and mixing ingredients together that you'll feel like Remy from Ratatouille.
        </p>
        <p>It can be as simple or as complicated as you'd like it to be but I'm going to give a little
            showdown to how I made it and it saved my life.
        </p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>white rice (better if it's at least a day old</li>
            <li>any veggies you have literally</li>
            <li>soy sauce</li>
            <li>butter</li>
            <li>protein (I used chorizo, but chicken works great as well</li>
            <li>1 or 2 egg</li>
            <li>Appropriate seasoning, i.e. black pepper, sesame seeds, salt,
                anything that is to your liking
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather your ingredients. Thaw what you need to thaw. Rinse what you need to rinse. Chop what needs to be chopped.
                In this step I got my chorizo, cut up some leftover mushroom in an open pack, and some spinach that was beginning to wilt.
                Bonus points if you have zuchinni or the frozen pack of variety vegetables.</li>
            <li>Warm up pan on medium to low high heat and adorn it with butter.</li>
            <li>Cook your protein(chorizo or chicken or shrimp).</li>
            <li>Put protein aside and cut into smaller pieces for when it goes into rice.</li>
            <li>Sautee your veggies with some butter and black pepper (on the same pan)until golden brown.</li>
            <li>For your egg, you can either scramble now right on top of veggies as if an omelet, or fry it later and throw
                on top of your whole concoction. I prefer the latter.</li>
            <li>Throw in day old rice and mix it altogether (this part can be a bit messy).</li>
            <li>This part is where I'd put the soy sauce, and mix, mix, mix.</li>
            <li>Fold in (reference to Schitt's Creek) protein. (This means throw it in there too). </li>
            <li>Mix.</li>
            <li>Put on plate and enjoy with some kimchi on the side, some juice or water.
            </li>
            
        </ol>
